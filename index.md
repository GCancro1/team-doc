## Team DOC - Class of 2024

### Mission Statement

Developing software to detect and predict the spread of cancer, using novel techniques in computer vision and machine learning. We hope to resolve long-standing inequities in global healthcare systems by reducing the barriers to access to get routine, comprehensive medical screenings and diagnostics. 

### Research question

How can we create a general purpose machine learning model to screen for the most damaging forms of cancer?
